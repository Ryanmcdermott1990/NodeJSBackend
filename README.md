# NodeJS - Task Manager Backend 
After completing the React Front end application, I decided that it would be a logicial progression to move to incorporating a NodeJS backend, this was done using a framework called Sequelize, which is an ORM to map requests sent from the front end to a SQL database. 

- How to set up a NodeJS Server  
- How to use Models to construct the parameters for each db field, assigning each applicable data type and set any rules on the fiels, (e.g. Not Null, Auto Increment etc..)
- How to use Controllers to define methods on how to manipulate data
- The process for building a full stack application 

Things I can improve on this app are;

- Developing Backend Before the Front-end
Through doing this project it became clearer, that backend programming is where I am stronger, hence I should have started building the backend and ERD before moving on to building the view layer. 
As a result there were many issues when integrating the backend and front end, which were also not helped by the front end application not considering factoring in a backend when the code was designed.

# How To Run 
To run the server simply run
### `node server`
This launches the server which listens for requests on PORT 8080 on your local host
